5. Distance Traveled
Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can be calculated with the following formula:
Distance 5 Speed 3 Time
A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the following:
• The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
• The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
• The distance the car will travel in 15 hours

"""

# Store speed in variable
speed = 70

# Display the miles traveled in 6 hours
print("In 6 hours, the car will travel " + str( (speed * 6)))

# Display the miles traveled in 10 hours
print("In 10 hours, the car will travel " + str( (speed * 10)))

# Display the miles traveled in 15 hours
print("In 15 hours, the car will travel " + str( (speed * 15)))
