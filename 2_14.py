14. Compound Interest
When a bank account pays compound interest, it pays interest not only on the principal
amount that was deposited into the account, but also on the interest that has accumulated
over time. Suppose you want to deposit some money into a savings account, and let the
account earn compound interest for a certain number of years. The formula for calculating
the balance of the account after a specified number of years is:
A 5 P(1 + nr)nt
The terms in the formula are:
A is the amount of money in the account after the specified number of years.
P is the principal amount that was originally deposited into the account.
r is the annual interest rate.
n is the number of times per year that the interest is compounded.
t is the specified number of years.

Write a program that makes the calculation for you. The program should ask the user to
input the following:
• The amount of principal originally deposited into the account
• The annual interest rate paid by the account
• The number of times per year that the interest is compounded (For example, if interest
is compounded monthly, enter 12. If interest is compounded quarterly, enter 4.)
• The number of years the account will be left to earn interest
Once the input data has been entered, the program should calculate and display the amount
of money that will be in the account after the specified number of years.

# Input
P = float(input('Enter principal amount: $'))
r = float(input('Enter annual interest rate: %'))
n = float(input('Enter number of times per year interest has compounded: '))
t = float(input('Enter number of years account will be left to earn interest: '))

# Process
r /= 100
A = P * ((1 + (r / n)**(n * t)))

# Output
print('After ', t, ' years, $', format(A, ',.2f'), ' will be in the account. ', sep='')
